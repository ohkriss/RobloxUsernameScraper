I dont need this anymore so just gonna release this..

Most scrapers can only do 1 username per request, this can do 50.
Took me 3 days to scrape everything and got left with a 10gb textfile, so if you plan to use this you should be aware of this..

Before you say anything, yes i know what json is, but using regex is just faster so why not..

Enjoy!
